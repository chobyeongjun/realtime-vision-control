"""CUDA Graph capture for fixed-shape infer + preproc.

On Orin NX the CPU launch cost of hundreds of tiny kernels dominates
small-batch inference. Once shapes are fixed, we capture the
preproc+infer sub-graph and replay it with a single launch.

If capture fails (dynamic shape, disallowed op, etc.) we fall back to
regular eager execution without affecting correctness.

        ROOT CAUSE FIX (2026-04-21):
          Default torch.cuda.graph() uses 'global' capture mode. ZED SDK's
          grab() runs on its own internal stream — uncoordinated with our
          pipeline streams. During capture, ZED grab issued a cudaCall on
          its stream → cudaErrorStreamCaptureInvalidated → silent fallback
          to eager → run was 40Hz instead of 80Hz, non-deterministic.

        Diagnostic from Jetson trace:
          [ZED][WARNING] [Grab] A CUDA error occurred:
            operation not permitted when stream is capturing (900)
          → cudaErrorStreamCaptureInvalidated

        Fix:
          1. capture_error_mode='thread_local' — only THIS thread's CUDA
             work is tracked; ZED's other-thread streams cannot invalidate.
          2. Retry up to max_retries — even with thread_local there can be
             transient races (driver init, etc.).
          3. Hard sync before each attempt — drain stale GPU work.
          4. On total failure, raise — silent eager fallback hides bugs and
             makes runs non-reproducible. Caller can catch if they want
             eager fallback explicitly.
